# Blinn: Explore Fragment Shaders with LLMs

Welcome to **Blinn**, a tool to play around with fragment shaders, with live changes and AI prompting.

The name **Blinn** is in recognition of Jim Blinn, a pioneering computer scientist whose work has significantly influenced the field of computer graphics. His contributions to the development of texture mapping and the Blinn-Phong shading model have laid foundational principles that continue to shape how we render and perceive digital imagery today. By naming this application Blinn, we pay homage to his legacy and the profound impact he has had on both the technical and creative aspects of computer graphics.


## Features Checklist

- [x] **Real-time Shader Editing**: Blinn provides a real-time editing environment for fragment shaders, allowing you to see the effects of your code as you type.
- [x] **AI Assistance**: Leverage the capabilities of Claude through the [blinn-api](https://github.com/lessthan12parsecs/blinn-api) to generate shader code, optimize performance, and get creative suggestions.
- [x] **Three.js Integration**: Built on top of Three.js, Blinn offers a seamless experience for those familiar with the library and those new to 3D web development.
- [ ] **Preloaded Examples**: Jump straight into shader development with preloaded examples showcasing what's possible with Blinn and Three.js. 
## Getting Started

To get started with Blinn, clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
